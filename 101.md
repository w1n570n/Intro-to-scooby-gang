So, you've just survived an encounter with the supernatural. I'm sorry, but you're one of the special ones.

Most people, surviving the unknown, rationalise it mighty quickly. I say they're the lucky ones; they get to live an ordinary life.

It's not too late for you - just say the word and we'll get you blackout drunk and maybe you wake up tomorrow thinking this was a bad dream. 

You're still reading, so welcome to the Scooby Gang. I've been having this chat with newbies since about ... 2009? Anyway, it's long overdue that I wrote down a pamphlet.

I don't know who called us The Scoobs first. i was going to say we don't have a talking dog, but what else are werewolves? Unfortunately you have me as the closest approximation to the hot nerd.

depending on what you just survived:

- yes, vampires are real. usually evil, they'll get their own chapter in a minute
- yes, demons are real. Most the ones we encounter qualify as evil, but lots of variation here
- yes, werewolves are real. Few develop the mental discipline to be considered Good or Evil when hulked out.
- yes, witches/warlocks/wicce/wizards/DAMNED FINGER WAGGLERS/ are real. If this applies to you, talk to author (W1n5t0n) about training. As these tend to be humans, we span the usual range from Good to Evil and everything inbetween.
- Gods are probably real. There's a few major demons who you reallly don't want to get into a debate over semantics with when they show up and call themselves a god. And that time Frigg plugged a giant magic hole with her fine derriere. 
- Basically, the line at this point between "some sort of demon" and "something else" is very fuzzy. And what does it matter if the giant angry flaming ball of eyes with a magic sword levelling your city is an angel or some other sort of demon when your city is on fire? Does the existence of Leviathan imply the existence of YHWH, or are you too busy trying to stop it eating you?
- the majority of the scoobs and henchmen of Team Evil[^1] are humans with no power. Knives, guns, molotovs are pretty effective in this fight.

[^1]: not a recognised name for TE
- Membership of the Scooby Gang and Team Evil is not fixed. Everyone has their reasons, but damn if betrayal doesn't sting.

# Vamps

bumpy foreheads and fangs. Both only appear at gametime, they might be any other weirdo with heliophobia[^2] until dinner time.

[^2]: fear of the sun

I'm making some shortcuts to keep this brief. One of these is that they are *usually/mostly* a demon piloting a corpse. 

Right now, you need to know enough to survive. Should've taken the offer to get blind drunk and forget this.

They're vulnerable to violence, but they have demon-powered muscles. Pack a knife at a minimum, fists might as well be a giant neon sign that says FREE SNAKS. 
They drink blood. We should really keep a track of our team's blood groups for emergency transfusions.
They really hate wood through the heart. Where the rest of them is like a demonic murder machine, their chests are like cardboard when it comes to stakes.
They really hate holy power and fire. Any experience brewing a molotov?
Sunlight burns them. I've not managed to keep a captive long enough to argue sufficiently that the moon is visible by reflected sunlight. I must talk to the SuperScis about storing sunlight.

Vamps create vamps, sort of like a blood-bourne disease. The demon gets the memories of the person they now have as a meat puppet, and none of the conscience. Be prepared to stake a demon wearing the face and voice of a loved one.

Finally,
- they do cast a reflection
- they can cross running water[^3]
- crosses usually repell weak-willed ones
- they generally can't come in uninvited[^4],[^5]
- you can't distract them by dropping a load of grain so they have to stop and count it
- they dont usually sparkle in daylight. 
- they don't give a shit about garlic. Well, they don't give any shits. At least, I've never seen one enter the lav except when hunting. 

[^3]: think  how limiting mains water + sewers would be otherwise
[^4]: keep an eye out for fricking latin motos like Open to All who Seek Fricking Knowledge,
[^5]: or since England is shagging old, maybe they were invited in 2 centuries ago.

## vampire groupies

Human henchmen for the vamps. Might be blackmailed, might have had "immortality" dangled in front of them.

Argue with them about morality if you want, but rhetoric is hard over gunfire. 

### Effing Dracula

Godsdammit I'd forgotten about this arsehole until writing about what vampires aren't.

This bastard has basically everything from the novels/movies. He turns into mist, hypnotises people, has a harem, has an effing castle that just appears and the normies think it's just sort of always been there. 

AVOID. He has lightning reflexes on the mist form that make him near unkillable. Your best bet is being sufficiently boring until he decides to go play somewhere else.
# demons

About the only thing these folx have in common is that most people just sort of ... dont't notice they're there. I'll lend you a copy of They Live! Good movie.

Generally human-shaped, but I can introduce you to Nick @ Leeds and show you the 100% real dragon skull.

Since civilisation, if we accept certain Histories, they're not native to this plane of reality. The vampire was supposedly a blood demon that cheated by hiding in a sacrificial human.

Cultists might do elaborate rituals to summon someone, again with promises of ULTIMATE POWAH. As with the vamp, generally someone needs to be ritually transformed. 

Some did decent rituals in the lower planes[^6] and got here. One or two were *exiled* here.

[^6]: not geographically lower. 

While they're usually antagonistic to us, we see a slither of the shadow of the politics of the lower planes. Often one will form an uneasy truce with us to dick over a political rival.

I might be too dualistic in the last paragraph, probably better to say that their morality is totally alien to us. If he's still around, talk to Spyder for 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean but DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING. Note to self: cross this out when Spyder inevitably betrays us and needs sending home.

Usually vulnerable to violence, but there's great variability. We're talking about stuff that's been magically shunted from another plane, invulnerability to knives is an easier trick than that. 

Generally vulnerable to holy power. Dammit, that needs its own section now. 

Honestly, if it's a Big Bad we'll likely need to research what its Achilles Heel is, and might need to bespoke forge a magic bullet to go in it. 
If it's a lesser Bad, then hitting it until it stops getting back up usually works.
