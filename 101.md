So, you've just survived an encounter with the supernatural. I'm sorry, but you're one of the special ones.

Most people, surviving the unknown, rationalise it mighty quickly. I say they're the lucky ones; they get to live an ordinary life.

It's not too late for you - just say the word and we'll get you blackout drunk and maybe you wake up tomorrow thinking this was a bad dream. 

You're still reading, so welcome to the Scooby Gang. I've been having this chat with newbies since about ... 2009? Anyway, it's long overdue that I wrote down a pamphlet.

I don't know who called us The Scoobs first. i was going to say we don't have a talking dog, but what else are werewolves? Unfortunately you have me as the closest approximation to the hot nerd.

depending on what you just survived:

- yes, vampires are real. usually evil, they'll get their own chapter in a minute
- yes, demons are real. Most the ones we encounter qualify as evil, but lots of variation here
- yes, werewolves are real. Few develop the mental discipline to be considered Good or Evil when hulked out.
- yes, witches/warlocks/wicce/wizards/DAMNED FINGER WAGGLERS/ are real. If this applies to you, talk to author (W1n5t0n) about training. As these tend to be humans, we span the usual range from Good to Evil and everything inbetween.
- Gods are probably real. There's a few major demons who you reallly don't want to get into a debate over semantics with when they show up and call themselves a god. And that time Frigg plugged a giant magic hole with her fine derriere. 
- Basically, the line at this point between "some sort of demon" and "something else" is very fuzzy. And what does it matter if the giant angry flaming ball of eyes with a magic sword levelling your city is an angel or some other sort of demon when your city is on fire? Does the existence of Leviathan imply the existence of YHWH, or are you too busy trying to stop it eating you?
- the majority of the scoobs and henchmen of Team Evil[^1] are humans with no power. Knives, guns, molotovs are pretty effective in this fight.

[^1]: not a recognised name for TE
- Membership of the Scooby Gang and Team Evil is not fixed. Everyone has their reasons, but damn if betrayal doesn't sting.

# Vamps

bumpy foreheads and fangs. Both only appear at gametime, they might be any other weirdo with heliophobia[^2] until dinner time.

[^2]: fear of the sun

I'm making some shortcuts to keep this brief. One of these is that they are *usually/mostly* a demon piloting a corpse. 

Right now, you need to know enough to survive. Should've taken the offer to get blind drunk and forget this.

They're vulnerable to violence, but they have demon-powered muscles. Pack a knife at a minimum, fists might as well be a giant neon sign that says FREE SNAKS. 
They drink blood. We should really keep a track of our team's blood groups for emergency transfusions.
They really hate wood through the heart. Where the rest of them is like a demonic murder machine, their chests are like cardboard when it comes to stakes.
They really hate holy power and fire. Any experience brewing a molotov?
Sunlight burns them. I've not managed to keep a captive long enough to argue sufficiently that the moon is visible by reflected sunlight. I must talk to the SuperScis about storing sunlight.

Vamps create vamps, sort of like a blood-bourne disease. The demon gets the memories of the person they now have as a meat puppet, and none of the conscience. Be prepared to stake a demon wearing the face and voice of a loved one.

Finally,
- they do cast a reflection
- they can cross running water[^3]
- crosses usually repell weak-willed ones
- they generally can't come in uninvited[^4],[^5]
- you can't distract them by dropping a load of grain so they have to stop and count it
- they dont usually sparkle in daylight. 
- they don't give a shit about garlic. Well, they don't give any shits. At least, I've never seen one enter the lav except when hunting. 

[^3]: think  how limiting mains water + sewers would be otherwise
[^4]: keep an eye out for fricking latin motos like Open to All who Seek Fricking Knowledge,
[^5]: or since England is shagging old, maybe they were invited in 2 centuries ago.

## vampire groupies

Human henchmen for the vamps. Might be blackmailed, might have had "immortality" dangled in front of them.

Argue with them about morality if you want, but rhetoric is hard over gunfire. 

### Effing Dracula

Godsdammit I'd forgotten about this arsehole until writing about what vampires aren't.

This bastard has basically everything from the novels/movies. He turns into mist, hypnotises people, has a harem, has an effing castle that just appears and the normies think it's just sort of always been there. 

AVOID. He has lightning reflexes on the mist form that make him near unkillable. Your best bet is being sufficiently boring until he decides to go play somewhere else.
# demons

About the only thing these folx have in common is that most people just sort of ... dont't notice they're there. I'll lend you a copy of They Live! Good movie.

Generally human-shaped, but I can introduce you to Nick @ Leeds and show you the 100% real dragon skull.

Since civilisation, if we accept certain Histories, they're not native to this plane of reality. The vampire was supposedly a blood demon that cheated by hiding in a sacrificial human.

Cultists might do elaborate rituals to summon someone, again with promises of ULTIMATE POWAH. As with the vamp, generally someone needs to be ritually transformed. 

Some did decent rituals in the lower planes[^6] and got here. One or two were *exiled* here.

[^6]: not geographically lower. 

While they're usually antagonistic to us, we see a slither of the shadow of the politics of the lower planes. Often one will form an uneasy truce with us to dick over a political rival.

I might be too dualistic in the last paragraph, probably better to say that their morality is totally alien to us. If he's still around, talk to Spider for 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean but DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING. Note to self: cross this out when Spider inevitably betrays us and needs sending home.

Usually vulnerable to violence, but there's great variability. We're talking about stuff that's been magically shunted from another plane, invulnerability to knives is an easier trick than that. 

Generally vulnerable to holy power. Dammit, that needs its own section now. 

Honestly, if it's a Big Bad we'll likely need to research what its Achilles Heel is, and might need to bespoke forge a magic bullet to go in it. 
If it's a lesser Bad, then hitting it until it stops getting back up usually works.

# Werewolves

People cursed to be an adorable furry Hulk on a full moon or when you piss them off. Hint: don't piss them off by calling them "adorable", "furry" or "Hulk".

When they're people, normal human rules apply - some are good, some are evil, some are banging vampires...
When they wolf out, Hulk rules apply. For the first many movies "HULK SMASH". Some develop the mental fortitude and Zen to become smart Hulk.

Which is to say that if you encounter one that's not a teammate, they're probably about to try killing you, eating you and maybe fscking you. I'm not taking bets on which order they do those.

If you find one that's caged/chained - leave well alone. Some sensible folk chain themselves up before wolf moon so they don't go out on murderrampage. 

Scratches/bites seem to transmit the condition. If a party member gets scratched, sorry mate but you're going in the cage come wolf moon. 

We need to test riot shields on these guys. Since they work with teeth and claws we might be able to 'herd' them away from our side and send a beserk woofit into enemy lines. 

Violence works, silver is super effective, holy is ineffective. Fire might be a very good or a very bad idea - they might not have the intelligence to stop drop and roll, or you might just make it angry. And on fire. 

# Wizards

Any human can be trained to perform a ritual to a good enough standard to get an effect. Maybe you need 20 such people, a book not published by Llewellyn, and maybe a bit of concentrated power like we keep finding laying around the sites of potential apocalypses. 

But. Rituals are slow. 

If someone is shooting at you, you want shielding NOW, not 10 minutes from now. 

The mage has a gift at casting magic _quickly_. 

I could no more catalog what sort of magic you might face than a punchy person could describe all the ways someone might smack you with a baseball bat.

Some of us are gifted, some spent way too long in restricted areas of libraries, occasionally someone takes a shortcut by cutting a deal with some power, possibly a demonic power. 

If anyone is tempted to take shortcuts, buy me a drink, I'll try to disuade you from that notion. 

Mostly I'm thinking of human wizards here, but demons generally have some sort of innate magic, FFS I just remembered Dracula exists again. He got Gypsy magic in a card game. Eff you D. Generally vamps don't do magic. Werewolves are generally too busy murdering/eating/shagging to do magic.

Just as the Ogre swinging half a tree at you will eventually get tired muscles, magic has its cost(s). Cast a little bit, and we'll generally go temporarily mad. Of the order of half an hour per madness. Sometimes this is homicidal, so for the love of all that is holy have a protocol for binding and gagging your mages. Yes, including me. 
Cast far, far too much and the forces that are trying to balance out will explode your head. 

Fighting against one - depends what they have in their bag of tricks. Blocking bullets like you're The One is pretty common these days. Unless they've been casting other BS you're probably going to need to change clip a couple of times before their head explodes.

Sheer numbers tends to be your best bet - most magic is limited to a small number of targets. Prioritise spell flingers, and some people will finish the fight *not* on fire. 

Normal human vulnerabilities. I've not yet encountered a special anti-magic metal or kryptonite or any such thing. In the right circumstances someone might have their power gifted in a talisman that's shatterable, but who's that good a shot + it'll just get shielded.

Fighting alongside one - I say our strength is in shifting the combat. Holy damage comparible to a werewolf's punch is farily easy to teach, and means we can straight up explode fairly basic vamps. We're pretty solid for distracting enemies by setting them on fire, or for giving us a temporary bullet shield. 

*If we are giving the party a temporary bullet shield. Use the time wisely. There is not very long we can hold the shield up before our heads explode. This is not the time to stand still and laugh at our enemies*

I repeat: have a plan for dealing with the raving psycopath after the fight. 

If you've been shy wiz so far - say hi. We have training available, and we don't hang witches. At least one wants to tell you that some are well-hung. He's not in earshot, I just know him well enough to put his comment in.

# The Slayer

Special 1-off demon-powered human vampire-killing machine. Sometimes the _De Jure_ leader of the Scoobs. Occasionally the _De Facto_ leader.

There is a lot of Lore on the history of the Slayer, but if reality is malleable then history is 2ce as malleable. 

Suffice to say, this is our Champion, keep this one in one piece. 

# Summary/Closing Remarks

Our side's strength is our unity. We have our disagreements, but they are the exception rather than the norm. Team Evil has their moments of unity, but that is exceptional. 

Work together for Frigg's sake. 

Communicate. If team punchy thinks that this group of vamps isn't even worth breaking a sweat, let team magic know to hold off for now. Otherwise we might cast enough magic to turn murder hobo, which might be more danger than the vamps we didn't know weren't worth ...

Similarly, team magic - tell team punchy about the limited window of bullet stopping. I know I wrote it here, which is part of my attempt to communicate it, but I don't think proof-reading this is top priority for team punchy. 

If one of ours is down, coordinate a push forwards. One person pushing forwards, well now there's 2 of ours down. The whole team pushing forwards, that's a rescue. 

With that said...
I _expect_ the demons in the party to betray us. _Everyone_ else in the party is capable of betrayal.
